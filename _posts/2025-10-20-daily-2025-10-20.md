I always forget to journal. day before yesterday i did some changes to website and and thought about journaling but yet again i forgot.

Any way ,
Its diwali festive season recently its monday today but holiday
I went to gym. I have worked for job for liek few hours today
Did time pass on mobile for like few hours, just now but i dont really feel satisfied.
I am trying my hard to not sleep in the afternoon i am even dringking two sachets of coffee but still to no effect its fucking hard to not sleep and feel terrible
even after sleep i feel not so good but atleast i can do things and not feel sleepy

so im gonna take a night bath now to freshen up and do japanese.

I am listening to signalis's Die totenisel synthwave remix , its pretty good but i had decided to not listen to signalis's music but i guess its really hard. This is not so depressing though.
i guess its okay

things i wanna do-
1) start with comprehensible japanese again. You still haven't started
2) start workikng on some project
