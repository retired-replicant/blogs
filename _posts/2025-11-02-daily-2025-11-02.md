Konnichawassup bromodachis,

Its sunday, short week huh, is it just me or do every one feel time slipping away like sand in hand. the more you try to hold on to it the more you lose it,

its really difficult for me to rest , even when i rest it doesnt feel the same , like if i try to rest for 1 hour its so fast that its over before i even realize.
again maybe this is because of my brain rot filled brain , not reels and short but something to always listen in background. i had reduced that a lot this week, but still at the end it still creep-ed in a bit.

lets wrap this rant for a later time because its late and i also go weekly review .

SO
as for today , lets see ....

Not too bad huh, its almost smilar to yesterday
again the majority portion here is of the OS project today

### Japanese -
- did anki
- did wanikani
- thats it ☹️

### OS
was not planning to do a lot but ended up doing a lot , after these session my head always starts to hurt lol

- I implemented the code for GDT table and basically entering into protected mode
- i think i spent stupid amount of time debugging and trying to understand the immediate address and stuff , caused a lot of confusion because the OS tutotrial i am following is in nasm and i m doing it in GAS AT&T syntax 
- anyway but i did entered into 32 bit and in the evening i worked more to added func to be to bale to run c code in protected more, (had to seperate the linkerss) although its just loading 1 byte into memory , i should probably do dynamic linking

thats was it for today

## Weekly review

![Pasted image 20251102232751.png](/assets/images/Pasted image 20251102232751.png)


its  better than last week, last week its was 35 hours , so +13 hous increase , its was easy to climb this much because last week was start lol, its gonna be tough to keep on climbing now onwards.


anyway apart from this i watched  a documentary today , on youtube , and it was of a anime , Baan , its made by gigguk , a anime creator , one of the host of trash taste podcase , basically one of the boys.
he realized a anime short film Baan , which took him 2 years to make , and this documentary was not about how a anime is made , It was about him , it was more personal, how passionate he was regarding this, how many challenges he faced and stuff

if i havent already converyed how much i love Baan , i have cried so much watching it , i cried at its trailer , then few time watching its actual thing , then today more 4- time watching the documentary , Man i cry a lot, but people trying to achieve there dreams just breaks me , its a very easy way to make me cry.
its music is composed by the Goat Kevin Penkin.
 
ill list down some of my fav,
1) https://youtu.be/STktjfQmJOM?si=I1sRsGSb2d4uxfxJ - ofcourse the title tract
2) [Departure](https://youtu.be/STktjfQmJOM?si=I1sRsGSb2d4uxfxJ)  now actually i am listening to Departure , it has got such a vibe , its like those nervous before begining you journey then slowing calming yourself down with the warmth supporting and reminding everthing would be okay
3) [Gateway](https://youtu.be/Xm8Flzqsk40?si=0y-QYSpah4Vw7hWV) the flutes are also so good in this
4) [Homebird](https://youtu.be/PFp3jopfcvQ?si=PSdQUwNEsMO0vzVs) this omd the credits music , i have cries so many times watching this scene , the feeling returning to home , be it place , some people , a instruement, missing home ,that thing you are longing for to return back to which you are trying to forget but just cant , because its maybe the most important thing to you , you are use to it , you feel conformt begin around it, with it.



The documentary so fucking good i cant express in words , maybe it was just me but watching him slowly turning his dream in reality , slowly the characters turning into reality , its such a site to behold . 

okay i am getting emotional again , i think i have to end this here and just fuck off to sleep , i gotta go to gym early  tomorrow . i have lot of work . I want to be not be in anxiety always
