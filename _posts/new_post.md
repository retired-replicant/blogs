"Remember our promise… it’s time. I don’t have much time left… we don’t have much time left," Alina said, her pale voice almost swallowed by the rumbling waves and the distant thunder of bombs tearing apart the city of Inyae.

Erika could barely understand her through the roar, but she stayed focused, gripping the small, fragile boat’s controls with trembling hands. The vessel pitched and groaned under the assault of towering waves, each one threatening to tear them apart.

Unable to make herself heard, Alina reached out and grasped Erika’s palm. Their eyes met — Alina’s gaze soft but sharp with unspoken pain. She managed a faint smile, a thin veil over her fear and sorrow.

In that silent look, Erika finally understood. But she refused to answer, refused to surrender. She turned back to the controls, determined to reach the distant shore of Wanret Islands.

Then, without warning, the sky ignited. Both women turned upward in unison as a comet streaked across the heavens, its massive glowing trail almost swallowing the entire sky. It plunged toward Inyae like a burning dagger, signaling the final chapter of the city — and perhaps, of their story.
