Okay to day is monday , yeah i missed a weekly review but not worries , i am gonna do it today.

Again this is not too bad, lsat time it was 49 , so its almost the same.  i mean could have been better.

But one good news is i worked on OS a bit last 2 days, did the dynamic size kernel loading .

And also stated a new deck for N3. so thats a progress.

Tbh i think its enough and i goota get back into my grindset , it just doesnt include griding, i would have to have a good sleep , good diet, maybe less background sound during the focus hours (yeah need to do this).

Past few days were not much differnet , as expected i am still drowned in dispatch but i am coming closer to the surface everyday, so i think its gonna be okay.

Today focus hours are gonna be not so good maybe 6 hours or something.


Oh yeah i could i fucking forget , i updated the hyprland , so had to do the configuration fucking again so it tooks me like 3-4 of my sunday. but yeah got some new feel on the desktop
