### OS  

yesterday i did really worked on OS , dint really read anything about it.

unfortunately ,today also i havent got any change to work on it. maybe now after writing this i would get back to it

But i did kind of finished the OS book that i was reading there are still some like 50 pages or less reamining but that is of distributed system which is not really a core part of it. but i would still read it. I finished all the essential concepts of OS
- CPU virtualization
- Memory virtualization
- File system(persistence)
- Concurency

### Japanese
I did my normal anki and wanikani today. as of wanikani if everything goes right then i would be finishing the level 7 in 3 days
anki is also on good pace not really missing a day on it

and yeah i still haven't resumed consuming to Japanese content. :( i would try to start it tomorrow.



### Music -
I was watching a short live stream of **sora the troll** yesterday and the end of it he sang a song, which is his own song. and i really liked it it was great.

Came to know dude composes his own BGMs and is a musician as well along with being a troll lol. 

The song is called [**Good bye**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZOc7BDx1Ro)  . 


For sunday i would like to chill, but thats the hard part i dont know how.

I am planning to open a (anon) twitter account and start posting on it. I am not really firm on that idea but i would thing about it on Sunday which is tomorrow.

Would edit this post if do some more reading on OS implemetation
