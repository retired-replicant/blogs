I just finished wathing 10 episodes of your lie in april and i felt rollercoaters of sad emotions watching through these 10 episodes,

i dont remember my child hood it was nothing special no desires no goals no aspirations

but now that i have grown i do have them seems like its too late , i am old not and society expects something different than me , time is not waiting for me , i dont what to do with this feeling i think i can never escape from this feeling , time is moving so fast this life seems just like a day its gonna end soon , things would happen and i would forget and in blick of a eye it would end , sure maybe i would i be able to manage to do some things but not all, this world would never be the same as i can imagine , as other have imagined and put expressed from their story i am not sure if authors of these story felt the same and this made this shows so express their feeling , but i do feel that way by watching thier creations, i would be so great if there was a way to actually alter you life make the life around you how you want , sure i am working hard to make such things happens , but you know there are some things that just cant be changed and at least for now , its impossible to go back in time , its impossible to change the past, its impossible to go in future , its impossible to change the majority of society at you will, many things that you cant control, what should i do with all this thought should i just give up , and try to erase it, or i dont think theres anything else that i can do.

i feel like i am child in body of grown man, i cry so easily , i just cried in one these episodes where kaori asks arima where he has started playing again and i just busted, that hit me , i have given up on guitar , on music atleast for a while since i dont have enough time and i that line hit like a truck .

i am such a stupid person , i dont feel like anything in this world can make me satisfied , because the things that i dream of are out of this world. such a stupid problem with no solution , i have turned into something so different from everyone else that its getting difficult being around people.

How does this end. I feel like the art is the most precious thing humans can create which can tell things which cant be written or spoken with words , if i have to leave something behind maybe i would like to leave something like that behind me.

I want my life to be like a movie/ show. It has direction, it has music , it had meaning . My life doesn't have any of those , I am trying to meaning to my life but unfortunately this life is played on a stage which others share and they don' want the same meaning that i want , they don't agree with the same direction as i want . I do i make a movie out of this like that i like when its filled with actors who wont listen to me?
