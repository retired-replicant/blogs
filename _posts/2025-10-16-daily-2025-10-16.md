Long time not see. I intended this to be daily logs but it hasnt turned out to that case .
Lately I have not been able to do some things that i want to do.

Although some things are still going as like wanikani and anki because of discipline
on wanikani i am almost level 7 now.

One important thing that i had started almost a month ago was starting to ramping up my japanese input . It was going good for a week but i wasnt able to continue it.

I am starting it today . would also try docunment the progress here continuously so it can make me feel bad when i dont do it lol

The other thing is , I am missing programming i am programming a little for work but not to an extent i use to do. I almost completed the smtp server that i was trying to build the only main part remaining is to deploy it and setup various configuration so other smtp sever consider it as reputated and do not block emails.

I would like to work on something in programming side but i am not sure
The book i was reading about OS also got dropped off , last section of it is still remaining i want to complete it.
