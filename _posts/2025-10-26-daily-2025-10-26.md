THis doesnt include today' but today also i did 7.5 hours.
Damn boi thats progress from previous week which was virtually nothing.

Slowly getting there.
### Read / OS Project
Today also i didnt really got time to work on OS project
Nor did i read today much.

However i did find about this OS boiler plate called JOS which MIT uses for their practical to teach students some OS concepts.
I found a streamer who was also Building a OS and he mentioned it.

To be honest on the first look i dont want to use it as of now. I done want another abstraction. 

### Japanese
did anki + wanikani
NO comprehensible input today also.

### Music

I listened to lot of **Goodbye** by sora the troll , which i mentioned in yesterdays post.

BUTT
I randomly came accros this cover song of [Jane Doe](https://youtu.be/68GVloi2Jr8?si=HJ4c5BZGkqGKaWAh) from Chainsaw man, and its good. like not to over stimulating , pleasant to listen in background to while writing .
Lots of CSM covers coming in since it recently released in US and Europe. I love it. But i hate the fact that many times they dont realease the trailer version of OST.
I was looking forward to trailer OST , we did got it but it just wasnt the same.

happened with CSM s1 as well.

Still i love kensuke ushio's work

Some recommendation of kensuke ushios work

### Liz and the blue bird
I want to watch this move just because of its music. for some reason you can identify its kensuke ushio music when you can hear inside of the piano haha

- [Ensemble ](https://youtu.be/lnvpIX_193I?si=RCE3yiLCBKl3nweM) OMG this one is so good, this introduced to me know intrument Oboe , there is so much emotion in this scene , i havent watched this movie , but the two lead performers were having conversatoin with just music here
- there were more osts from this i liked but i cant remember the name of it
I want to watch sound euphorium , Lix and blue bird is set it its universe only, thats another good music+ slice of life anime
