Now its way too long, i even missed the weekly and its time for the next weekly review

i mean , this last week went so fast , i did not get time to even think, but i have returned with a very good news, this last week was my PB in terms of hours focused

![Pasted image 20251215001932.png](/assets/images/Pasted image 20251215001932.png)

63 hours!!! lets goo i am not really sure if i would be able to increase this to be honest

its 12:20 am now , yeah midnight , and i am gonna have a night bath🤣.
Okay alright i gotta go i would be back to write more probably
(A shower later)

oh yeah i am back , lets complete this shit now .

its really beein 2 weeks huh, since i had last written anything here.
First of all this previous week was phenemonal(dispatch reference).  I would be really happy if i am able to replicate it this week as well.

althought this sunday wasnt as well as i would have liked it to be. the same stuff dealing with fucking afternoon sleepliness and non productive time. I tried to sleep for like 1 hour then gave up then started working and then again felt sleepy to went o sleep after like 2 hours and sleep for like 1.5 hours .

The only thing that i wish i would have improved last week was the gym, i didnt went to gym for like 3 days last week. although i did had a good leg day.

Lot did happen , and i am not sure if i would like to tell everything tbh, something are better to be forgotten but i am not sure , cause if i would forget them then they would cease to exist.

So among bad things were like yeah , lots of fights in the house, even one of my parent tried to harm themselves. But everything was fine in the end . Not good but fine.

Okay now thats out of the way. 
what are some things that you are planning on improving this week

1st - I am planning to work more on japanese , since this week i really put japanese on back burner, i  only did wanikani.
oh yeah and one more thing , i just purchased the wanikani's lifetime membership. 🎉 lets fucking goo. although it did really put a huge dent in my wallet 200 dollars , idk about you but thats the most expensive memebershiop  i have every bought, it was hard , although i knew this was the cheaped option int he long term , but still i has a bit hesistant , but this time i did decided to pull the plug cause its was the once a year offer (100$ off)
2nd  - the next thing that i would wan to imporove next week is OS dev. i really is on halt this last 2 weeks, like i think around 1 week ago i reasearched a bit about this some books that i wanted to purchase for OS , since i was getting a gift coupon from the work . so yeah
I found this 2 books that would be really imp for me - 1st woiuld the i think its called os dev 0 to 1 and its focused on bootloader specifically, although i have already built the bootloader it would be a good after read, to really polish my understanding .

and the 2nd book was OSDI , the minix book , i am still unsure about this one tbh , its hard man to invest in a book and not knowing if it would be usefull or not .

Probably i would reasearch a bit today before sleeping today about this books.

okay 

one more thing that i would want to tell you is - i really spend a lot of time on comprehension today - like i read few article on NHK easy web , and also watched a lot of videos , overall like 2 - 3 hours of JP today. so i was happy with that , i would be more happy if i am able to continue this next week as well.

This is my plan - i think before after i would start with japanese and then i would jump to work.
