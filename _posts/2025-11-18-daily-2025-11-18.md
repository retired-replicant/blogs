Its donna increase a bit more like 15-20 minutes since i am not dont yet.

Only concerning thing is sleep , my sleep schedule is fucked and like i sleep around 2 and woke around 7.
Would try to get that shit fixed.

Other than that i have nothing much to say
Like its getting better , and it would keep on getting better, but i dont know what better is , not feeling something which feels meaning full , getting back to meaningless , is that what getting better mean. Then probably i am getting better.

Did classis japanese plus work today
I need to decide on N3 deck i am gonna follow up honestly.
