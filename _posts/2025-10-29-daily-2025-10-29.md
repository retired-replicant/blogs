### Japanese 
- anki -> to day i spend like 2 hours on anki because i had to do all the pending reviews of like a month of my custom deck
- wanikani -> finally level 8
- input -> watched like 1+ hour of youtube video

### OS
- didnt read the book today as well
- butt spend 2 more hours to understand bootloader -  to day it hit me with memory segmentation in CPU which basically is required one addredd space is larger than  the resiter size
  for example addresss space -> 20 bits but eh registers are 16 bits.
  Honestly my next plan is just write a bookloader to load the kernal , then let the kernel print hello world using VGA ig.
