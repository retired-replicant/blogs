Is this probably the first time for me writing the logs on a consecutive day ? lmao

I did my basic routine today - little bit of work , japanese (anki and wanikani) and reading

yeah idk if i meantioned or not i did started reading the OS book again , ig its been 3 days .
I think if it continues then i would be able to complete the book by 10 days.

The things i am thinking is where or not should i attempt building a kernel. because i follow one principle if i cant build it , i haven't understood it yet. I did reasearch a bit especially looked up [osdev.wiki](pos)
