Is this probably the first time for me writing the logs on a consecutive day ? lmao

I did my basic routine today - little bit of work , japanese (anki and wanikani) and reading

yeah idk if i meantioned or not i did started reading the OS book again , ig its been 3 days .
I think if it continues then i would be able to complete the book by 10 days.

The things i am thinking is where or not should i attempt building a kernel. because i follow one principle if i cant build it , i haven't understood it yet. I did research a bit especially looked up [osdev.wiki](https://osdev.wiki) an especailly after spending several minutes reading , the list of required knowledge was so big, like especially assembly , C (i have codded in C++ a bit but never C,), cross compiler etc.

Also making a Complicated project in a new language is probably a mistake , which i have learnt a hard way (with rust)
to be honest even after reading the book i am quite confused about where to even begin.

Like i think i first need to select the architecture that i am trying to build like x86 or idk know other.
I need to know what boot loader is , what are different drivers , like hecj even building a simple Hello world OS is also so difficult.

I am not sure if jumping into building OS without getting aquainted with C and assembly a good idea.

I don't really know , i would give this a though.
