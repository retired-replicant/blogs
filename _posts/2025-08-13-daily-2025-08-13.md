Today was not too bad at least till now ,atleast mental health wise

i took a day off , didnt do much work today probably just 1-2 hours of job work and 1.5 hours of japanese

i still have to register for JLPT though i procastinating it a lot .

Also yeah , didnt went to gym today , my legs freking hurt and today was leg day , yesterday did too much of cardio

its still fucking hurting though , i hope it recovers when i sleep today .

watched ludwigs vod of him reacting to 1000 players simulate civilization in minecraft .
and i gotta say it , it was pretty awesome , like the music ,direction and story was great and much better than other similar brain rot minecraft videos i have seen.

yeah thats it , bye

listening to flawed mangoes btw
