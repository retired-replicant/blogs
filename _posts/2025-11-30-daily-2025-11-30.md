the worst week probably in terms of productivity, i need to change something

its mostly because of the my sleep schedule is fucked , i need to get that in order .

I also need to start on japanese comprehension consistently, i was researching the next book to read , something os related , i got very confused but i think i found a very good book on bootloader stuff and other book which i can use for kernel stuff

so for bootloader stuff then i would use - os 0 to 1 
and for kernel I would be using minix os book
