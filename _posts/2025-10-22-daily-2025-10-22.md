This is definetely the first time journalling three days in a row .
Anyway,

As i discussed in the previous log that i am really unsure and intimidated to work on custom OS  because of lot of reasons so As a rational programmer , i went ahead with it anyway

And hey i was at least able to build a hello world kernel which would print the message on the screen.(Although i just copy pasted it from the os dev wiki).
But still i atleast learned something , bascially we use the VGA buffer to do this.
Tomorrow i am planning to learn more about this what this VGA buffer is . and maybe try to add additional functionality like captunring keyboard input and then displaying it.
