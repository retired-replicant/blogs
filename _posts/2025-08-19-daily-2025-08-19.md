yoo i just reached level 3 on wanikani. currently according to my pace i am taking about 1 week to complete a level , unfortunately only 3 level are free , so i would either need to take a recurring subscription or a lifetime  subscription.
probably looking to go for lifetime subscription but not really sure maybe 1 year subscription would be more than enough , since i might change the medium of learning kanji after a year. 

any way this last week was between ok and bad at some times, some days were really tough some were good .
even though the week was not that great , i was able to pull almost 50 6 hours focus work evey day on average 
i really gotta take the diet consistently , i have been cheating couple of days a week , i should try to gamify this diet , i have gamifying challenges and having some structured plan and routine to do it really puts on the grind , the issue with me is i always forget to log my diet into an app.

listening to flawed mangoes 
listening to tokyo ghoul's ***horizon***  ,

  really great song , had discovered it few months ago and loved it on first listen itself . 
   i really like this nostalgia for a city , for a home , for a place where you belong really gets me , because i feel like i don't belong at the place that i am at , and not really sure if there there exists does exist such place in real world. I would at least try to find it
